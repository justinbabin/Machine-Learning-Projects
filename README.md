## Computer Vision: Clothing Recognition
Using TensorFlow, Keras to train and test a computer vision model in identifying different articles of clothing

### Sample of Training Set  
Images are preprocessed to grayscale to avoid confusing the model with colours.  
Model live-updates every epoch with training time, loss, and accuracy. It also has a nice little loading bar.
